# SentinelNet
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) capable of identifying malicious network trafic and cyber-attacks in real time. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system will classify trafic as normal or suspicious based on historical data.

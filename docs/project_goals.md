# SentinelNet Project Goals

The goal of SentinelNet is to develop an **AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** that can accurately identify and classify malicious network traffic in real time. Unlike traditional intrusion detection systems, which rely on static signatures and fixed rules, SentinelNet leverages **machine learning and artificial intelligence** to detect both known and novel attacks.

## Key Objectives
1. **Data-Driven Intrusion Detection**  
   Train models on benchmark datasets such as NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017 to identify different categories of cyber-attacks.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**  
   Ensure the system can analyze live network traffic efficiently, providing rapid alerts to reduce damage.

3. **Robust Performance**  
   Focus on improving key performance indicators like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and reducing false positives.

4. **Scalability & Deployment**  
   Design SentinelNet as a modular system that can be deployed across various environments â€” from enterprise networks to cloud infrastructures.

## Real-World Impact
Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and organizations require proactive defenses. SentinelNet aims to **reduce the risk of data breaches, financial loss, and downtime** by providing an intelligent, adaptive intrusion detection solution that goes beyond traditional approaches.
